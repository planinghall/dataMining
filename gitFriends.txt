git status
 - shows what branch you are currently working on (DONT BE MASTER)
 - shows what files are or are not staged

git add --all
 - stages all files that have been edited, but not staged

git commit -m "Some message here"
 - saves all staged files to local repository

git push origin someBranchName
 - saves changes to remote

git checkout -b someNewBranchName
 - use the "-b" if you are making a new branch
 - if you are simply switching branches, do not use this flag
	 - i.e. git checkout someNewBranchName

in order to update local repository based on changes in remote
git fetch --all
git pull origin remoteName (remoteName might be master)
